# GDC-PM Session Log — Append-Only History

**Format:** One paragraph per session, newest first. Never delete entries.  
**Usage:** New sessions read the last 3–5 entries only for recent decision context.

## Session J (June 3–4, 2026) — *Major planning session; H1 full implementation*

**Code committed:** `e8f8b78` (feat: H1 Live Telemetry & Strategic Advisor), `862d674` (docs handoff)  
**Cluster image:** `sha256:7da84c...` (fault-trigger-ui)

**What was built and deployed:** H1-Live-1 (`/api/live-telemetry/{asset_id}` endpoint, SCADA card polls real DB every 5s), H1-Live-2 (`"normal"` key in `INTELLIGENCE_FEED` with 3 baseline docs), H1-Cards-1 (2-card layout, GDC card renamed "Assessment", PIP/Amps/Temp trend rows), H1-LLM-1 (Gemma templates upgraded to risk-weighted financial advisory), H1-P3 (`_run_recovery_thread()` posts 36 climbing DB rows over 3 min post-approval).

**Major design decisions made this session (Session J planning portion):** The Fleet Operations tab was previously removed (do not re-add). H1/H2/H3 tabs are the complete primary demo experience. The `DEMO_MASTER.md` document was written as the authoritative permanent spec — all future sessions read this first. Three-act narrative locked: H1=Protect (gas lock, 25 min window), H2=Discriminate (slug flow, false positive prevention), H3=Optimize (VFD Bayesian optimization, Vertex AI Vizier + local XGBoost). RUL metric replaced by "Window of Options" (viability timeline). Financial case delivered through LLM only, no static cards. "Consult Agent" button eliminated — LLM auto-starts on injection. Evidence Convergence Wall (5 source categories, activation sequence) and Cited LLM Copilot (superscript citations) added as required UI patterns for all three tabs.

**Physics corrections made:** Gas lock failure is thermal (motor loses cooling fluid flow) NOT mechanical dryout ("running dry" is incorrect — pump is still submerged). 25-minute PNR is defensible per API RP 11S and ESP manufacturer guidelines. Three defensible SCADA vs ML claims: fault discrimination, probability scoring before thresholds, context fusion. Advanced SCADA CAN do some multi-sensor correlation — ML wins on discrimination, probability scoring, and context fusion specifically.

**Key rejections this session:** Rejected "RUL" as primary H1 metric (engineering term, not audience-friendly). Rejected static financial cards (numbers without context). Rejected H2 abandonment (reframed as false-positive prevention — compelling to production engineers who have experienced unnecessary pump pulls). Agreed H2 needs temperature-vibration decorrelation as primary visual, not a generic evidence list.

**Next session's primary task:** Implement H1 tab redesign from `DEMO_MASTER.md` spec — 2D SVG well schematic, Evidence Convergence Wall, Cited LLM Copilot (auto-streaming), Window of Options timeline. Single `app.py` + single `index.html` replace_in_file call. Then rebuild/push/rollout.

## Session I (June 3, 2026) — *H1 UX overhaul — slate palette, sensor tabs, splitter, corrected financials*

**Code committed:** `0949491` (feat: H1 UX overhaul), `ddb8a3b` (docs handoff)

What was built: Global Tailwind dark slate palette replaced harsh neon palette across the entire UI. H1 drag-resizable splitter between chart pane and RAG pane. H1 multivariate sensor tabs (PIP / Motor Amps / Winding Temp) above GDC forecast chart with `h1ForecastData` cache. H1 assessment state machine (`h1Recovering` flag, 4 states). VFD terminology with Hz + RPM equivalents. Recovery phase (approveH1VFD sets h1Recovering=true, polls for 2 min). Financial card integrity fix: VFD cost corrected $2,500→$0, physics panel net avoided updated, financial card restructured with risk-weighted SCADA-only expected loss (~$97,500).

## Session H (prior) — *V1+V2 integrity violations fixed and verified*

**Code committed:** `65275b7`

Fixed integrity violations: H3 Vizier tab now uses real Vertex AI Vizier Gaussian Process Bandit (not fake deterministic trials). Field intel documents now use live Gemma4 Ollama generation via `_intel_generator()`. VFD cost displayed was $2,500 (fixed to $0). H1 assessment label was "INTERVENE NOW" (fixed to "Intervention Needed" with dynamic state machine). All known display-vs-reality mismatches resolved.
